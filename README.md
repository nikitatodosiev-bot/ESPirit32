#ESPirit32: Breathe life into your hardware.

Code less, create more.
Heavy on features, light on resources.
Stable. Secure. Yours.


This repository contains the ESP32 BIOS, example devices, and example games.

## Overview
- This Ecosystem is designed as an open-source platform for custom devices and applications.
  - We don't believe in "bloatware." In an era where software demands more and more, we go back to the roots.
- You can create your own hardware or games using this BIOS.
  - You create ideas, we handle - ESPirit32 is engineered to be lightweight, ensuring that every CPU cycle is spent on your logic, not our overhead. It’s built to fly - even on "potato" hardware.
  - Enthusiasm shouldn't be crushed by a steep learning curve. We bridge the gap between "powerful" and "approachable." With clean APIs and transparent documentation, we ensure that moving from an idea to a working prototype is a matter of minutes, not days.
- ESPirit32 belongs to the community. No hidden blobs, no proprietary locks, and no paywalls. It is open-source in its purest form—auditable, modifiable, and forever free. If you see a way to make it better, the door is always open.
