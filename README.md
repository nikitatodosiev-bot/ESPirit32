# **ESPirit32: Breathe life into your hardware.**

*Code less, create more.*

*Heavy on features, light on resources.*

*Stable. Secure. **Yours**.*

## Overview
- This Ecosystem is designed as an open-source platform for custom devices and applications.
  - We don't believe in "bloatware." In an era where software demands more and more, we go back to the roots.
- You can easily create your own hardware or games using this Ecosystem.
  - You create ideas, we handle - ESPirit32 is engineered to be lightweight, ensuring that every CPU cycle is spent on your logic, not overhead. It’s built to fly - even on a rock.
  - Enthusiasm shouldn't be crushed by a steep learning curve. We bridge the gap between "powerful" and "approachable." With clean APIs and transparent documentation, we ensure that moving from an idea to a working prototype is a matter of minutes, not days.
  - You're **new**? No problem - ***pick a device and start your homebrew project***
- ESPirit32 belongs to the community. No hidden blobs, no proprietary locks, and no paywalls. It is open-source in its purest form—auditable, modifiable, and forever free. If you see a way to make it better, the door is always open.

- Supported by us, **Created along with the community**
- **Have a question?** Ask other people - they are *the same explorers as* **you** - help each other out!
- "Experimental" is for labs; **"ESPirit32" is for the real world**. We prioritize a stable core that handles edge cases gracefully, ensuring your projects work **100% of the time**
- You may know that making **your own** *thing* can be pretty hard, say no more(lol) - with our API you can finally start coding - **no more monotonous tasks**; while you already test your project, others only #include bullshit0, bullshit1, bullshit2, (and so on...).
